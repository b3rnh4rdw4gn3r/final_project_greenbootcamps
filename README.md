## Extra Task after talk to Haritha 04.07.for 43min
"Looks good" for the final_project_bernhard_wagner_V0.ipynb
- extra ideas added: Use confusion matrix, just look at accuracy and f1-score to choose advanced model, if perdormance not better find out reasons why
- extra idea added: Do feature engineering, perform cross-validations over again
- extra idea added: For clustering use alternative methods as well and compare
- ! Ask for Maria's Feedback thereafter
