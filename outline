### Dataset
azwatch_subscribers.csv

## Classification
1) Import libraries & dependencies
2) Identify target and feature variables
3) visualize the features to check for outliers
4) clean features
5) encode categorial features
6) apply base model like logistic regression
7) compare confusion & quality of models
8) take the best performer
9) try answer the Task 1
10) Try optimizing best performer (gridSearchCV and RandomCV)
11) Try feature engineering
12) Try optimizing model
13) if performance lower > combine features and newly created features
14) Try best performer again
15) perform GridSearchCV or randomCV
16) Identify important features, visualize feature importance
17) Try best performer again
18) Re-Answer Task 1

## Clustering
1) Base-model Kmeans
2) visualize it
3) try othe models, compare by factors
4) identify best performer 
5) try optimizing it ---> if applies, document possible ways (Regularization, CV(k), Hyperparameter-Tuning, Pruning/Early Stopping, Ensemble-Methods)
